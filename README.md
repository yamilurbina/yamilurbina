# Oh hai, Mark!
I'm a software developer focused on DevOps, the cloud and deploying services
online. My passion lies on making software work and understanding how software companies
can improve their processes and then provide tools for their teams to increase
value and better speed to market.

### Community
Sharing knowledge is something I greatly enjoy and I was part of building a tech
community called [La Paz Cloud](https://lapazcloud.com/blog/) back when I was in Bolivia.

I also gave several talks on Cloud technologies, DevOps and software building
for other communities and tech events. You can find slides
  [here](https://speakerdeck.com/yamilurbina).
